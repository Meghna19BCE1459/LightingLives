      <h2>Why Study in A Renowned Institute?</h2>
      <h5>It's of extreme importance that we choose the right place to develop our slills and prepare ourselves to jump into a phenonmenally challenging corporate world/career.</h5>
      <div><img src="renowned.jpg" width="700px" height="500px" alt="institute"></div>
      <p>It is the college you go to along with how you utilise the time spent there that decides the success of your career. Before choosing a college, do a little research. These days it is possible for a college to become well-known through advertising even if it is not accredited or recognised.
         So, first check if a college is recognised or approved by the University Grants Commission or the All India Council for Technical Education. Next, try to find out the quality of faculty members. A good placement cell can make a difference but if the other college is better in many other respects, then you can always establish a placement club with like-minded individuals. No matter which college you choose, pack your college experience with internships, part-time jobs and social activities.</p>
      <p>Very often, students make the mistake of choosing a course that is popular in India and assume that it will be in demand overseas too but that is not always the case. Thus, understanding the job market in the country you are planning to study in will help you make a better decision. The GRE and Toefl scores are required if you are planning to study in the US. A score of 90 percentile is generally considered good. It will be better if you gather some work experience before proceeding for a masterâ€™s degree abroad.</p>
